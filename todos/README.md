README

I made this after reading a go REST-ful API tutorial, but I've made some modifications since then to better suit my taste. I changed the 'repo' to be a map instead of a slice, and implemented a DELETE option for endpoints.

This is actually just my to-do list for my to-do list.

-Return 404 if people try to GET a nonexistent todo
-Figure out how to get the 5 latest TODO's for the index while respecting deleted TODO's
-Figure out a real persistence strategy
