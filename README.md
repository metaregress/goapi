-Make a D&D action generator. So have resources like race, class, skill used, and maybe target? Basically I want to have all these things so that I can have a 'randomize' endpoint that produces actions like 'A tiefling cleric uses nature to identify a plant.' Then I can practice describing those actions and their outcomes to become a better DM.
